    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>To determine the concentration of an unknown acid solution by titrating it with a standardized base solution.</p>

    <h3>Materials:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Burette</li>
        <li>Pipette</li>
        <li>Erlenmeyer flask</li>
        <li>White tile (for better visibility of the color change)</li>
        <li>Standard solution of Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), 0.1 M</li>
        <li>Unknown solution of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)</li>
        <li>Phenolphthalein indicator</li>
        <li>Distilled water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Rinse the burette with the NaOH solution and then fill it with NaOH. Make sure there are no air bubbles in the tip of the burette.</li>
                <li>Use the pipette to transfer 25.0 mL of the unknown HCl solution into an Erlenmeyer flask.</li>
                <li>Add 2-3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator to the HCl solution. The solution should be colorless.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Titration:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the Erlenmeyer flask on a white tile to better observe the color change.</li>
                <li>Slowly add the NaOH solution from the burette to the HCl solution, while swirling the flask continuously.</li>
                <li>Continue adding the base until you observe a faint pink color that persists for at least 30 seconds. This indicates that the endpoint has been reached.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Recording Data:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Record the initial and final readings of the burette to determine the volume of NaOH used.</li>
                <li>Repeat the titration at least two more times to ensure accuracy and consistency in your results.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Calculations:</h3>
    <p>Use the formula:</p>
    <p>
        <code>M<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = M<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></code>
    </p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>M<sub>1</sub></code> = Molarity of HCl (unknown)</li>
        <li><code>V<sub>1</sub></code> = Volume of HCl (25.0 mL)</li>
        <li><code>M<sub>2</sub></code> = Molarity of NaOH (0.1 M)</li>
        <li><code>V<sub>2</sub></code> = Volume of NaOH used (from burette reading)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Calculate the concentration of the unknown HCl solution using the average volume of NaOH from your trials.</p>

    <h3>Safety Precautions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wear safety goggles and gloves throughout the experiment.</li>
        <li>Handle acids and bases with care to avoid skin irritation.</li>
        <li>Dispose of all chemicals as instructed by your teacher.</li>
    </ul>
